#lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each line
#with the phrase In Python you can. . . . Save the file as learning_python.txt in
#the same directory as your exercises from this chapter. Write a program that
#reads the file and prints what you wrote three times. Print the contents once by
#reading in the entire file, once by looping over the file object, and once by stor-
#ing the lines in a list and then working with them outside the with block.
